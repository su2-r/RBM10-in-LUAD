Visualization of RNA and Protein expression of RMB10 with MAPK and PI3K
pathways and EGFR grouped by sex and existence of RMB10 SNVs

**Introduction**

This project focuses on the visualization of RNA and protein expression levels of RBM10, a gene associated with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), in relation to the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways and EGFR. The analysis will be conducted by grouping data based on sex and the presence or absence of RBM10 single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

The inspiration for this project stems from a study on Taiwanese LUAD patients (Chen et al., 2020). This study highlighted the elevated mutation frequency of RBM10 in female patients, particularly those with specific age, stage, and smoking characteristics. Notably, RBM10 mutations were often co-occurring with mutations in TP53, KRAS, XIP2, and ZNF804B. However, unlike these other genes, RBM10 exhibited decreased RNA and protein expression.

Given RBM10's potential role as a tumor suppressor, further investigation is warranted. It is known to induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation, and regulate the cleavage of FAS and the MDM2-p53 pathway.

While some studies suggest a tumor-promoting role for RBM10, others have shown conflicting results. For instance, Sun X et al. (2019) reported upregulation of RBM10 in LUAD cells and tissues, leading to decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and caspase-8) and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

However, in the Taiwanese (TW) cohort, RBM10 exhibited decreased RNA and protein expression, contrasting with other oncogenes like KRAS, LABM1, and PIK3CA. Additionally, RBM10 has been hypothesized to be positively correlated with EGFR and the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways (Cao et al., 2021).

To explore these discrepancies, I visualized the RNA and protein expression of RBM10, EGFR, and genes involved in the MAPK and PI3K pathways (Yang et al., 2019), grouping the TW cohort by sex and the presence of RBM10 SNVs. The goal was to identify unique characteristics within the TW cohort, particularly focusing on the potential role of RBM10 in driving LUAD in the absence of SNV mutations.
