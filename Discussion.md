The A and B plots show the expression levels of RNA and proteins in the MAPK and PI3K pathways. These plots compare three groups: females with the RBM10 SNV mutation, females without the mutation, and males without the mutation. The plots don't reveal a clear distinction between females with the RBM10 SNV mutation and the other groups. Only RBM10 shows significantly lower expression levels. While some genes like BRAF, MAPK3, and MAPK3 RNA exhibit bimodal expression patterns, this is likely due to the small sample size in the group with the RBM10 SNV mutation.

The C and D plots compare the overall expression levels of RNA and proteins between females with and without the RBM10 SNV mutation. Females with the mutation generally show lower expression levels. Although the sample size is small in all groups, the expression levels of EGFR are similar across groups, but the range of expression is narrower in females with the RBM10 SNV mutation.
